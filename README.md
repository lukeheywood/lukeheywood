# Governance-First Systems & Coherence Under Load

I design governance‑first architectures for complex digital and AI‑enabled systems.

My work addresses a structural gap most organisations never solve:

> System power grows faster than the structures that define who owns it, who can stop it, and what must never be allowed to happen.

Rather than starting with tools or models, I work upstream — at the constitutional layer where legitimacy, authority, boundaries, and failure conditions must be defined before any system can safely operate.

## 🏛 Primary Work — System Governance Framework

A public constitutional framework for governing socio‑technical and AI‑enabled systems.

It defines:

* What qualifies as a governing system
* Where authority must sit
* How governance drifts under pressure
* Unacceptable system states
* Why escalation is not governance
* Revocation as the true test of control

Technology‑agnostic. Applicable across AI, government, platforms, finance, healthcare, and infrastructure.

This is not implementation.
It is the layer systems must answer to.

## 🧪 Scenarios — Structural Stress Testing

The framework repo includes hypothetical stress simulations illustrating governance breakdown under real‑world pressure.

They demonstrate how systems fail when:

* advisory output becomes behavioural authority
* automation outruns ownership
* legitimacy drifts silently
* responsibility exists without control
* revocation cannot occur despite authority claims

These are fictional, clinical governance exercises — not commentary on real organisations.

## ⚙ Applied System — ONE

ONE is a governed AI system built inside the framework to prove constraints can be embedded from the ground up.

It demonstrates:

* contract‑based boundaries
* explicit authority separation
* inspection surfaces
* memory governance
* workflow‑driven AI use
* drift prevention under load

ONE is not positioned as intelligence.
It is an inspectable governed system.

### ⚙️ one-runtime — Runnable Public Mirror

* Memory OS
* Autopilot Workflow Mode
* Meta OS
* Orchestrator UI
* Governance‑aware execution

### 🛡️ contract-stack — Governance Authority

* Formal contracts
* Admissibility rules
* Regression gates
* Stop / revocation enforcement
  👉 [https://github.com/lukeheywood/contract-stack](https://github.com/lukeheywood/contract-stack)

### 🔍 system-diagnostics — Drift & Failure Lens

* Drift detection patterns
* Competing intent structures
* Hidden coupling failures
* Quiet degradation modes

## 🔍 Themes Across All Work

Governance before capability
Authority before automation
Boundaries before scale
Inspection before trust
Revocation before responsibility

I build systems that remain legible, constrained, and structurally honest — even under pressure.
