# ONE GitHub Lab  
### A Systems Lens for Coherence under Load

Hi, I’m Luke. I design and explore AI-enabled systems that stay reliable in messy, real-world conditions.

This GitHub is my **lab** for developing and sharing patterns for:
- making sense of complex platforms,
- preventing drift over time,
- and building workflows that remain coherent under human and operational load.

It’s not about products.  
It’s about **system skeletons** and **how systems hold together.**

---

## 🧭 The Lens

I approach systems with a few core ideas:

- **Coherence under load**  
  Systems should stay understandable and dependable even as complexity, scale, and human pressure increase.

- **System skeletons**  
  Good systems start with clear intent, boundaries, and structure — not just tools.

- **Governance & contracts**  
  Invariants, guardrails, and explicit constraints prevent slow drift into unsafe or incoherent behaviour.

- **Drift & diagnostics**  
  Most failures come from misaligned purpose over time, not from individual bugs.

- **Memory + workflows**  
  AI systems work best as pipelines with memory, validation, and artifacts — not prompt-only interactions.

- **AI as pipelines, not prompts**  
  Treat LLMs as components inside governed workflows, not as autonomous decision makers.

## 🧪 The Lab

These repositories are reference implementations and pattern labs aligned to that lens:

- 🧠 **one-reference-system**  
  A living reference system exploring how governance, memory, workflows, and human context interact in practice.  
  https://github.com/lukeheywood/one-reference-system

- 🧱 **system-skeletons**  
  Structural blueprints extracted from ONE for designing coherent systems.  
  https://github.com/lukeheywood/system-skeletons

- 🛡️ **contract-stack-examples**  
  Formal contract patterns, invariants, and guardrails for AI systems that must hold under consequence.  
  https://github.com/lukeheywood/contract-stack-examples

- 🤖 **ai-workflow-engine**  
  Examples of LLM-powered workflows built as governed pipelines with memory and artifact generation.  
  https://github.com/lukeheywood/ai-workflow-engine

- 🔍 **system-diagnostics**  
  Patterns for mapping systems, detecting drift, and making sense of complex platforms.  
  https://github.com/lukeheywood/system-diagnostics

  - ❓ **ask-and-memory-patterns**  
  Design patterns for Ask systems: memory indexing, retrieval boundaries, and grounded, traceable answers.  
  https://github.com/lukeheywood/ask-and-memory-patterns

(Many of these start as stubs — the structure and intent come first, then depth.)

## 🎯 What this is for

This lab exists to:

- explore how complex AI systems behave over time,
- extract reusable system skeletons,
- and share practical governance and workflow patterns.

If you’re interested in:
- AI workflows,
- system architecture,
- platform reliability,
- or diagnosing messy systems,

you’ll probably find something here that resonates.
